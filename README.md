<h1>Memory Management in Operating System</h1>
<p>The term memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format. It is used to store instructions and process data. The memory comprises a large array or group of words or bytes, each with its own location. The primary purpose of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the information they access, should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter.

To achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of memory, memory management is important. Many memory management methods exist, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends on the situation.

Before we start Memory management, let us know what is main memory is.</p>
<h1>What is Main Memory?</h1>
<p>The main memory is central to the operation of a Modern Computer. Main Memory is a large array of words or bytes, ranging in size from hundreds of thousands to billions. Main memory is a repository of rapidly available information shared by the CPU and I/O devices. Main memory is the place where programs and information are kept when the processor is effectively utilizing them.  Main memory is associated with the processor, so moving instructions and information into and out of the processor is extremely fast.  Main memory is also known as RAM (Random Access Memory). This memory is volatile. RAM loses its data when a power interruption occurs.</p>

<h1>What is Memory Management?</h1>
<p>Memory management mostly involves management of main memory. In a multiprogramming computer, the Operating System resides in a part of the main memory, and the rest is used by multiple processes. The task of subdividing the memory among different processes is called Memory Management. Memory management is a method in the operating system to manage operations between main memory and disk during process execution. The main aim of memory management is to achieve efficient utilization of memory.  </p>
<h1> Why Memory Management is Required?</h1>
<p>üåü Allocate and de-allocate memory before and after process execution.</p>
<p> üåüTo keep track of used memory space by processes.</p>
<p> üåüTo minimize fragmentation issues.</p>
<p> üåüTo proper utilization of main memory.</p>
<p> üåüTo maintain data integrity while executing of process.</p>
